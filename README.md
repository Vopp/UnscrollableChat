# UnscrollableChat
A simple and useless Chat

This is a Java assignment for a course about design patterns at University. The point was not to make a nice usable Chat app, but to create a program where there are no strong connections between classes. Focus is on OO-principles and abstraction but I also wanted to create a program where every single part is interchangable with a new one without disrupting the flow (exceptions, messages). The structure makes use of the Observer and Strategy patterns. I realise my code might be a bit overkill for what the program is, but I wanted to practice the mindset of writing code that allows for any class to be updated with a new class in the future.

However, it might not be so greatly modular as I hope and think it to be, as it hasn't been graded or commented yet. Any thoughts or suggestions on that matter are very welcome =).

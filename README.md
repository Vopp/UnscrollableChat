# UnscrollableChat
A simple and useless Chat

This was a Java assignment for a "Design patterns"-course at Uni. The point was not to make a nice usable Chat app, but to create a program where there exists no strong connections between classes. Focus was on OO-principles but I also wanted to create a program where each part was interchangable with a new one without disrupting the flow (exceptions, messages). It makes use of the Observer and Strategy patterns.

This is my first attempt at modularity, and it has not been graded yet. Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome =).

(Just extract the Jar-file to get all class/.java files)
